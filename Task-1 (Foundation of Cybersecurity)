CIA Triad 

1) Confidentiality

  •Meaning: Keeping data private and accessible only to authorized users.

  •Examples: Encryption (AES, SSL/TLS), Access control lists (ACLs), Passwords.

  •Violations: Data leaks, unauthorized access, eavesdropping.

2) Integrity

  •Meaning: Ensuring data is accurate, unaltered, and trustworthy.

  •Examples: Hashing (SHA-256), Digital signatures, Checksums.

  •Violations: Tampering, unauthorized modification of files, man-in-the-middle attacks.

3) Availability

  •Meaning: Ensuring systems and data are accessible when needed.

  •Examples: Redundant servers, Load balancing, Disaster recovery plans.

  •Violations: DDoS attacks, server crashes, ransomware locking access.


Common Cyber Threat Types

1) Phishing

  •Fake emails, websites, or messages trick users into revealing credentials or sensitive info.

  •Example: A fake banking email asking for login details.

2) Malware (Malicious Software)

  •Software designed to harm or exploit systems.

  •Types: Viruses, Worms, Trojans, Spyware.

3) DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)

  •Overwhelming a server or network with traffic to make it unavailable.

  •Often performed using botnets.

4) SQL Injection

  •Attacker inserts malicious SQL queries into input fields to access or alter databases.

  •Example: ' OR '1'='1 bypassing login forms.

5) Brute Force Attack

  •Automated attempts to guess passwords by trying all possible combinations.

  •Countermeasures: Strong passwords, account lockouts.

6) Ransomware

  •Malware that encrypts files and demands payment (ransom) for decryption.

  •Example: WannaCry ransomware attack.


Attack Vectors

1) Social Engineering

  •Manipulating people to reveal confidential information or perform actions.

  •Techniques: Pretexting, Baiting, Tailgating, Phishing calls.

2) Wireless Attacks

  •Exploiting weaknesses in Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.

  •Examples: Evil twin hotspots, Wi-Fi sniffing, WPA cracking.

3) Insider Threats

  •Attacks or leaks from employees, contractors, or trusted individuals.

  •Can be intentional (malicious insider) or accidental (negligence).


Steps to Set Up Lab

1) Install VirtualBox

2) Set Up Kali Linux

  •Download the Kali Linux ISO from kali.org

  •Create a new virtual machine in VirtualBox

  •Allocate 2–4 GB RAM and 20 GB+ disk space.

  •Install Kali Linux and create a user account.

3) Set Up Target Machines

  •Metasploitable2: Download and import the pre-built VM from SourceForge

  •Default login: msfadmin/msfadmin.

4) Configure Private Lab Network

  •In VirtualBox: File → Host Network Manager → Create Host-Only Network.

  •Set IP range (e.g., 192.168.0.1/24).

  •Attach Host-Only Adapter to all VMs.

5) Test Connectivity

  •Start Kali and target VMs.

  •Open terminal in Kali and run:

    ifconfig     # Check your IP
    ping <target IP>

  •Successful replies confirm the lab is ready.
